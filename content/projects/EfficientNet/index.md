In this project, I explored the realm of Computer Vision on edge devices by reimplementing EfficientNet from scratch. EfficientNet serves as the backbone detector for EfficientDet, a model commonly used for its efficiency in object detection tasks on edge devices. This endeavor not only enhanced my understanding of computer vision fundamentals but also allowed me to tackle practical challenges such as the vanishing gradient problem, a common hurdle in training deep neural networks. Furthermore, the project involved an experimental approach where I designed a custom architecture inspired by EfficientNet's principles. By employing scaling coefficients—a key feature of EfficientNet that systematically scales the model across depth, width, and resolution—I explored how different scales impacted the performance and efficiency of the model. This hands-on project was pivotal in solidifying my skills in deploying advanced computer vision models on resource-constrained devices, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable with edge computing in object detection.
