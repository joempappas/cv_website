In this project, I gained experience in working with embedded devices and microcontrollers. This project was coded in Adafruit's CircuitPython, utilizing If This Then That for event notifications to my mobile device, and a gyroscope for detecting motion. The goal was to be able to arm/disarm a motion sensor from your phone. Then, if the motion sensor is armed, send a notification to your phone if the sensor detects motion. I apologize upfront for the quality of the video, this was the best way I knew how to show the sensor in action!
